In fact, I remember my AP Calculus BC teacher discussing the Psychology and the Good Life almost every morning in our class.</p>
<h1 id="my-ways-to-reduce-stress">my ways to reduce stress<a class="anchor-link" href="#my-ways-to-reduce-stress"> </a></h1><p>I enjoy listening to music. After I complete my work or tasks I try to listen to music as short break before I get right back to work. I try to not worry about the amount of work or time I have, but it is still very stressful. I have found that a good way to keep myself accountable and manage my time better is to keep a list of the things I need to get done</p>
<h1 id="my-goals-for-this-year">my goals for this year<a class="anchor-link" href="#my-goals-for-this-year"> </a></h1><p>As a senior year in high school, I want to be prepared for college. I want to make sure that I am building good study habits to make my college life easier.</p>
<h1 id="CS-group-collaboration">CS group collaboration<a class="anchor-link" href="#CS-group-collaboration"> </a></h1><p>We are fun a group! My CS group has good synergy and we do our best to help each other out.</p>
