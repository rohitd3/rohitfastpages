Colin - UCSD, mechanical

Nitya - UCSD

AVO - UCI, CS

Alison - UCLA, cognitive science, minoring in Stats

Mabel - UCSD, Cognitive Science and Machine Learning

Andrew – UCSD?

How did you realize you wanted to do your major?

  - Colin: I can code well. I can 3d model much better. Peers told him to go to comp sci.

  - Avo: Did computer science from a young age. Functions and algorithms.

  - Andrew: likes java, deployment

  - Mabel: Did not like the class. Logical thinking really helped. Robotics team - helped with mission planning. Aerospace engineering was not structured well.

  - Alison: artsy businessperson, cog sci major, she wants to work on web design.

  - Nitya: took cs seriously in middle school and high school

What is the biggest challenge you have had with computer science?

  - Colin: Github throwing messages at you. There are solutions on the internet

  - Avo: clashing egos, focus on your own path, there is a lot of smart people out there, the next steve jobs is already beating you

  - Allison: Just starting, the temptation to BS, don’t cut corners, having the mindset to go above and beyond

  - Nitya: one of the biggest challenges is getting started in the area of computer science, very organized person and requires structure

Any PBL scenarios in college classes?

  - Colin: one hands on project in freshman year and one senior year

  - Mabel: College the first few years is general education, freeload of off you, they don’t expect interns to know much

Have you applied CS in your major if you have not applied majoring in CS?

1.  Colin: coding will be everywhere, oh hey i can code this part of the project, matlab\!\! - important for mechanical engineering

2.  Andrew: knowledge of CS can help any high level math courses

3.  Allison: math classes will require programming, R - stats needed

Colin mentioned something about Computation Aided Manufacturing
