    <p>Colin - UCSD, mechanical</p>

<p>Nitya - UCSD</p>

<p>AVO - UCI, CS</p>

<p>Alison - UCLA, cognitive science, minoring in Stats</p>

<p>Mabel - UCSD, Cognitive Science and Machine Learning</p>

<p>Andrew – UCSD?</p>

<p>How did you realize you wanted to do your major?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Colin: I can code well. I can 3d model much better. Peers told him to go to comp sci.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avo: Did computer science from a young age. Functions and algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Andrew: likes java, deployment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mabel: Did not like the class. Logical thinking really helped. Robotics team - helped with mission planning. Aerospace engineering was not structured well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alison: artsy businessperson, cog sci major, she wants to work on web design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nitya: took cs seriously in middle school and high school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is the biggest challenge you have had with computer science?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Colin: Github throwing messages at you. There are solutions on the internet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avo: clashing egos, focus on your own path, there is a lot of smart people out there, the next steve jobs is already beating you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allison: Just starting, the temptation to BS, don’t cut corners, having the mindset to go above and beyond</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nitya: one of the biggest challenges is getting started in the area of computer science, very organized person and requires structure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any PBL scenarios in college classes?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Colin: one hands on project in freshman year and one senior year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mabel: College the first few years is general education, freeload of off you, they don’t expect interns to know much</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Have you applied CS in your major if you have not applied majoring in CS?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Colin: coding will be everywhere, oh hey i can code this part of the project, matlab!! - important for mechanical engineering</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Andrew: knowledge of CS can help any high level math courses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allison: math classes will require programming, R - stats needed</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Colin mentioned something about Computation Aided Manufacturing</p>
