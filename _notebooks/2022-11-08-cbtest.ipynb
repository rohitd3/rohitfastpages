    "For it to be correct, evaluating x < 10 && y < 0 for x having the value 7 and y have a value of 3, x < 10 is true since 7 is less than 10 and y is less than 0 makes it false since 3 is not less than 0. The operator && evaluates to true when both conditions are true and evaluates to false otherwise. As a result, compiler will skip first output and execute the else statement for integer division for 7 / 3, which is 2."

The call whatsItDo(“WA”), sets its local temp to “W” and calls whatsItDo(“W”). The call whatsItDo(“W”) reaches the base case and doesn’t do anything since the length of “W” is 1.
